# Anagrams

This is a simple bored-afternoon project which can find 
name anagrams for your name or word. 
You just have to feed it with a list of names and execute it 
with a name, something like: $ ./anagrams names.txt juan

It is very likely that your name does not have any anagram, these are
a few that work pretty well: Adriano, Amelia, Daniel, Sora.

As I said earlier, you can also provide a word that is not a name 
or even a disordered name (i. e. "nuaj" instead of "juan").
